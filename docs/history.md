Project History
======

The prototype for the Pricing Engine was first developed in January 2016 by Matt Goldman. During the first half of 2017 the MSR Alice expedition team designed and developed a general purpose API and library based off of the pricing engine prototype. In September 2017, Matt Goldman and Brian Quistorff forked the Alice codebase https://msralice.visualstudio.com and began independent development.
